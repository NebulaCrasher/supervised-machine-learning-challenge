# supervised-machine-learning-challenge
Using scikit and machine learning modules to train and fit a model. 

## Reading in data
Firstly we use pandas to read in the csv to use in our model training/fitting. Also made a guess at which model would be better for this data set.

## Train_test_split
Split the data into 4 separate name spaces and set the random state to 25 so we can see variation between the test and train data sets.

## Logistic regression
Imported the logistic regression model from the sklearn library and then fit the model to the original bank data that was read in.
After that explored what the score of the logistic regression model was for later comparison.

## Random Forest Classifier
Performed the same process as the logistic regression model process and found that the score of the Random Forest Classifier model did indeed meet my expectations
of being the better fit.
